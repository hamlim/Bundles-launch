# Bundles Manual

Changing over to a quick and dirty way to test if people are actually interested in making bundles of links to share with others. 

Basic setup:

"DB" -> google sheets public open to anyone, backed up to another sheet every night

"Front end" -> separate pages for each bundle, just name the files the name of the bundles

Mockup:
-------
Using the carousel from Paperkit for presenting the content (need to check if it will be responsive for all devices)

Bundles Webapp                 {{Bundle Name}}           About @makebundles

<                                Content                                  >


ToDo:
-----
[ ] Create a public google spreadsheet  
[ ] create a template html file for the share page  
[ ] create a simple guide document for finding embed code for different sites  
[ ] Host these on goexploring.today under manual/{{bundlename}}.html  
[ ] Check if the carousel is responsive and can work on phones and tablets  

For Launch Page:
----------------
[ ] Use a proper landing page template  
[ ] Write copy about Bundles (copy)[#copy]

Why use Bundles?:  
  Create insightful collections of digital content  
  Great for sharing several youtube videos at the same time w/o making a playlist  
  Great for linking multiple types of media at once  
    Ever had a moment where you wanted to share a youtube video and a gif and a song?   
 
Features:  
  A bundle is dynamic, you can add and remove media as you wish  
  You can share the bundle anywhere, your recipient doesn't need a specific platform or need to sign in to see it  
  Great way to keep track of content you want to revisit later in the week
